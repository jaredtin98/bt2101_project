 Machine Learning for BT2101
 
 In this project, we executed various steps for prediction modelling namely
 1) Exploratory data analysis
 2) Data pre-processing
 3) Feature Selection
 4) Model Evaluation
 
The dataset contains payment information of 30,000 credit card holders obtained from a bank in Taiwan. Each data sample is described by 23 feature attributes (columns B to X). The target feature (column Y) to be predicted is binary valued 0 (= not default) or 1 (= default).
